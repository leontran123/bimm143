## Section 4: Population Scale Analysis 

Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.
```{r}
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(expr)
```

```{r}
nrow(expr)
```

```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```

Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3? 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(expr) + aes(geno,exp, fill=geno) + geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)
```
